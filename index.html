	<p><em>Hey guys! my name is David Luangrat. As you can see from the table above you guys should know about 88% of my life! Well, I'll tell you that I'm 19 years old. I was born in Athens, GA, but was raised in North Carolina till the age of 16. My family consists of two brothers, one sister, and 14 cousins I consider my siblings. I attend the University of Georgia, planning to pursue my bachelors degree in risk management at the Terry college of business. I chose to pursue this degree because I was always interested in how businesses work, especially insurance companies. My hobbies are: boxing, chilling out with friends, crying over school work, and eating good food. By the way this is one of my favorite sites in the world. You guys should visit it and try all the mac and cheese recipes because I did. <a href="https://www.allfood.recipes">Visit allfood.recipes!</a></em>
